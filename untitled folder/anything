                <h1>IRA vs Roth IRA</h1>
                <p>Both Roth IRA and traditional IRA are retirement savings accounts that offer tax benefits, but
                    there are some key differences between the two:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Tax treatment: The main difference between the two is how they are taxed.<br> With a traditional
                        IRA,
                        contributions are tax-deductible<br> in the year they are made, and the money grows tax-free
                        until
                        you
                        withdraw it in retirement,<br> at which time it is taxed as ordinary income.<br> With a Roth
                        IRA,
                        contributions are made with after-tax dollars,<br> which means you won't get a tax deduction for
                        contributions. However, <br>the money grows tax-free and withdrawals in retirement are also
                        tax-free.
                    </li>
                    <li>Income limits: Contribution limits for IRAs are the same whether you choose a traditional or
                        Roth
                        account,<br> but there are differences in income limits. With a traditional IRA, anyone can
                        contribute
                        regardless of income, but<br> contributions to a Roth IRA are limited if your income exceeds
                        $144,000 a
                        year.</li>
                    <li>Required minimum distributions: With a traditional IRA,<br>you are required to start taking
                        minimum
                        distributions once you reach age 72 (previously age 70.5)<br>, even if you don't need the money.
                        There
                        are no required minimum distributions with a Roth IRA,<br> which means you can leave the money
                        in
                        the
                        account to grow tax-free for as long as you want.</li>
                </ol>
                <p class="Differences">There are many more differences, but you see you will choose based upon your
                    preference
                    and of course your income level.<br> We learn a lot more in class like: Where to go to get into an
                    IRA
                    or
                    Roth IRA, and<br> Questions to ask when you find the place you trust to hold your money.</p>

                <h2>Trading Stock Options</h2>
                <p>One of my personal favorite things to do is trading options contracts.<br>Stock options
                    are
                    financial contracts that give the holder the right, but not the obligation, <br>to buy or sell a
                    certain
                    amount of stock at a specified price, known as the strike price, at or before a certain date,<br>
                    known
                    as
                    the expiration date. There are two types of stock options: call options and put options.</p>
                <p>Call options is you predicting that a certain stock will go up and Puts is you predicting
                    it
                    will go down.<br> Simple right NO! I will make it simple for you in this course.</p>

                <h1>Long-Term Investing</h1>
                <p>When it comes to the stock market, long-term investing is the safest way to insure that you
                    will
                    get a great return on your money<br>. The average return from keeping your money in a bank is 0.23
                    percent
                    vs roughly 17 percent from the stock market <br>(Depending on the stock and length that you will
                    hold).
